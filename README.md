# Rust-Stuff

Small projects to learn rust.

1. Simple guessing game, generates a random number. Attempt to guess it. Provides feedback on how far you are off.
2. Fibonacci Sequence, enter a number and will count upto that number.
3. Counts the vowels and consonants of a text file.
4. Reverse a sentence/word with recursion. Introduces the idea of lifetimes.
5. Checks whether a word is a palindrome. Uses recursion. Function duplicate.
6. Finds all the primes of a number. Finds pairs of primes which add upto that number. Removes duplicates.
7. Rot13 Encryption. Really basic encryption.
